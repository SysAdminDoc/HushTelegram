/**
 * Every patch in this source, and what Pause does to it.
 *
 * <p>Pause and safe mode work through the switches: while either is on, every feature switch
 * answers off and the hook behind it takes Telegram's own path. The hook's code is still there,
 * only its answer changes, and Debug logging keeps its saved value. An edit made when you patched
 * has no switch to ask: a removed manifest permission or a rewritten signer check stays in until
 * you patch again, so each such patch says what of it stays.
 *
 * <p>The settings screen and the diagnostic report read this list, so they can't disagree about
 * it. A family is found in this build by the name of its {@link SettingsStatus} method, the same
 * name the patch uses to switch that method on.
